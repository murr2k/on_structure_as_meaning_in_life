# On Structure as Meaning in Life

*Life, Recursion, and a Naturalized Account of Meaning*

Murray Kopit

Much of the contemporary search for meaning in life is driven by a sense that, if human existence is not anchored to something transcendent, fundamental, or cosmically privileged, then it must be arbitrary or empty. In discussions surrounding quantum mechanics and consciousness, this longing often expresses itself as an attempt not only to locate meaning inside exotic physics, but to attribute the very mechanism of consciousness to some specifically quantum process, as though subjective experience must be explained by invoking special physical effects. Whether particular quantum-level influences in biological tissue, such as electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity, play a significant or negligible role in neural dynamics is an open empirical question. However, whichever way such questions resolve, the central claim of this essay remains unchanged. Meaning does not hinge on the particular microphysical mechanism by which a system is implemented. It arises from the structure of certain physical processes themselves. I take the opposite view. If quantum mechanics is taken seriously as a universal, non-anthropocentric description of physical reality, then any account of meaning must likewise be non-anthropocentric. Meaning cannot be something granted by the universe to special observers. It must arise from the structure of certain physical processes themselves. Taking quantum mechanics seriously implies a universe in which no subsystem, including observers, possesses intrinsic ontological privilege. In a fully physical, decohering universe, observers are simply particular physical processes among many. If this is the case, then meaning cannot be a fundamental ingredient injected into reality for special kinds of systems. It must instead arise as an emergent property of certain forms of organization. This essay proposes that living systems possess intrinsic meaning not because of what the universe is, but because of what they are: recursively self-maintaining structures whose continued existence is their own ongoing project.

Meaning is not something added to life. Meaning is what life is doing.

## Abstract

This thesis proposes that intrinsic meaning in biological systems is neither externally assigned nor metaphysically endowed, but arises from the simple fact that living systems are recursively self-maintaining processes. A living system exists as a closed loop of organization that continually produces and preserves the conditions of its own existence. Crucially, this recursive loop is not homogeneous. It comprises both an inanimate informational substrate, encoded in DNA, and an animate metabolic substrate, expressed as a colony of cells. Life emerges from the continuous mutual regeneration of these two domains. Encoded within this coupled structure are constraints that bias behavior toward the preservation of the structure itself. These structural biases manifest as instinct. From this perspective, meaning is not something life seeks. Meaning is the continuation of the recursive process life already is. Human experiences of purpose, value, and significance are higher-order expressions of this same recursive dynamic, not evidence of externally imposed cosmic intent.

## 1. The Problem of Meaning

Philosophical discussions of meaning often assume that meaning must be supplied by something external to the individual: a deity, cosmic purpose, fundamental law, or objective teleology. When such external sources are absent or rejected, meaning is commonly perceived as threatened or illusory.

This framing implicitly treats meaning as a property assigned to existence rather than as a property of certain kinds of processes. The present thesis rejects this assumption.

Meaning is not something that existence possesses. Meaning is something certain processes generate.

## 2. Life as a Recursive Process

A biological system is not merely a collection of molecules. It is an organized process that:

* Maintains its internal structure.
* Repairs damage.
* Regulates internal variables.
* Produces components that continue these same functions.

Such a system is recursively self-maintaining. It exists as a loop in which outputs of the process become inputs to the same process.

If this loop stops, the system ceases to exist as a living system.

A living organism is therefore not a thing that happens to persist. It is a persistence-generating process.

## 3. Dual-Substrate Recursion: Animate and Inanimate Components

A critical feature of biological recursion is that it spans two qualitatively different substrates.

First, there is an animate metabolic substrate: a colony of cells that consume energy, maintain membranes, synthesize proteins, and actively regulate their internal state.

Second, there is an inanimate informational substrate: DNA. DNA is chemically inert with respect to metabolism. It does not act. It is a stable molecular structure capable of being copied and interpreted.

Cells read DNA to construct cellular machinery. Cells also copy DNA to preserve its structure.

DNA specifies how to build cells. Cells provide the physical environment in which DNA can be preserved and replicated.

Neither side is alive in isolation.

Life exists only in the closure of this loop:

DNA → cellular structure → DNA

This loop is not merely reproductive across generations. It is continuously active inside every living cell.

Life is therefore a hybrid recursive system composed of an active energetic layer and a passive informational layer. The living system is the closure of their mutual regeneration.

## 4. Intrinsic Meaning Defined

Intrinsic meaning is defined here as:

**The functional role something plays in the continued operation of a recursively self-maintaining system.**

Within dual-substrate recursion:

* DNA has meaning to the cell because it constrains viable structure.
* Cellular metabolism has meaning to DNA because it enables replication.
* Environmental resources have meaning because they sustain cellular activity.
* Signals have meaning because they guide regulatory behavior.

Meaning is therefore not symbolic at root. It is causal and functional. It is also important to emphasize that DNA is not intrinsically meaningful. Outside of a cellular context, DNA is merely a polymer. It becomes information only within the recursive loop that includes transcription machinery, ribosomes, and metabolic processes. The cell does not “read” DNA in a semantic sense. Rather, the coupled system of DNA and cellular machinery constitutes a closed interpretive loop. Information and meaning are not properties of either component alone, but of their ongoing interaction.

---

## 5. The Core Claim

For biological systems, meaning is simply to recurse, because recursion is the process they already are.

More precisely:

For biological systems, meaning is the continued mutual regeneration of their animate and inanimate components.

This is not a moral prescription. It is not a value judgment. It is a structural description.

---

## 6. Why This Is Not Tautological

The statement “life continues in order to continue” appears circular only if one expects meaning to be externally imposed.

In dynamical systems terms, a living system occupies a stable attractor in state space. That attractor corresponds to the closed DNA–cell loop.

Internal dynamics tend, on average, to restore this loop when perturbed.

Meaning is not “because it does.” Meaning is “because the system is organized around sustaining this particular closure.”

---

## 7. Instinct as Structural Expression

The coupled DNA–cellular structure encodes a system that continues. Encoded in that structure are not explicit instructions for particular actions, but biases in the space of possible behaviors.

These biases manifest as what we call instinct.

Instinct is not learned behavior. Instinct is not stored knowledge. Instinct is the expression of structure.

DNA does not encode specific actions. It encodes construction rules for a morphology and regulatory architecture whose physical dynamics naturally produce survival-supporting behavior.

Instinct is structure acting.

## 8. Core Classes of Instinctual Behavior

Instinctual tendencies cluster into several structural classes:

### Self-Maintenance

* Avoid sources of structural damage.
* Seek nourishment and hydration.
* Seek appropriate thermal conditions.
* Rest and sleep.

### Homeostatic Valence

* Deviations from viable internal states are encoded as negative valence (pain).
* Movements toward viable states are encoded as positive valence (relief, pleasure).

Valence functions as a control signal, not a goal.

### Reproduction

* Seek mate.
* Copulate.
* Protect offspring.

### Developmental Attachment

* Newborn stands.
* Seeks udder.
* Suckles.

### Social Cohesion

* Pair bonding.
* Family formation.
* Cooperative groups.

### Exploration

* Investigate novel stimuli.
* Play.

These behaviors arise because of how the system is built, not because the system knows what to do.

## 9. Shared Structure Across Bodies

The doe and her newborn illustrate instinct as shared structure.

Although physically separated at birth, they remain linked by a common inherited architecture. That architecture expresses itself as complementary instinctual behaviors: the newborn stands, seeks the udder, and suckles; the doe positions herself, allows nursing, and engages in protective and rearing behavior.

No learning or communication is required for this coordination.

The coherence arises because the same recursive architecture is instantiated in both organisms.

Instinct is shared structure expressing itself across bodies.

Shared structure may also manifest in subjective domains. Humans across cultures report common primitive dream motifs, such as falling, being chased, paralysis, or presence in dark enclosed spaces, as well as recurrent features in near-death experiences, including tunnel-like transitions, panoramic memory recall, or encounters with perceived presences. Within this framework, such regularities need not imply access to external realms or special physics. They may reflect conserved features of nervous-system architecture shaped by the same deep biological constraints. Just as coordinated mother–offspring behavior arises from shared inherited structure, recurrent subjective patterns may arise because large populations instantiate closely related recursive architectures. The commonality is structural, not mystical.

## 10. Emergence of Human Meaning

Humans add an additional layer to biological recursion.

Beyond DNA ↔ cell recursion, humans possess nervous systems that build internal models of the body, environment, other agents, and the self.

These models are themselves maintained recursively.

Human meaning arises when biological recursion becomes internally represented.

We do not merely participate in recursion. We experience ourselves as participating.

Subjective meaning is recursion with self-reference. Function becomes meaning when a recursive system comes to represent its own state to itself. In such systems, deviations from viability are not merely physical perturbations; they are internally registered as negative valence, and movements toward viability as positive valence. The system does not merely continue. It cares about continuing. Subjective meaning is therefore not identical to function. It is function that has become internally accessible.

---

## 11. Values, Goals, and Culture

Within this framework:

* Values are stable preferences that historically supported recursive viability.
* Goals are predicted future states expected to stabilize recursion.
* Culture is a distributed system for stabilizing recursion across many individuals and generations.

Art, science, ethics, and institutions are elaborations of biological meaning, not departures from it.

---

## 12. Existential Anxiety Reinterpreted

Existential anxiety arises when humans search for externally guaranteed meaning and fail to find it.

Within this thesis, that search is misguided.

Meaning is not outside the process.

Meaning is the process.

What can fail is not meaning itself, but alignment between internal models and the conditions required to sustain recursion.

---

## 13. Implications

1. No cosmic purpose is required for life to be meaningful.
2. Meaning is objective in a functional sense, but local to the system.
3. Ethical systems can be grounded in supporting recursive viability.
4. Artificial systems could possess intrinsic meaning if they instantiate genuine recursive self-maintenance.

---

## 14. Conclusion

Life is a process that maintains itself by coupling an inanimate informational substrate with an animate metabolic substrate.

This coupling is recursive.

Meaning is the continuation of this coupling.

Humans experience this continuation as caring, valuing, striving, loving, and choosing.

Not because the universe assigns purpose.
Not because consciousness is magical.

But because this is what recursive living systems do.
